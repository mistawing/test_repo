Question 1:
The CPU calls the scheduler which loops through process table and
calls swtch on each of the runnable processes. The switch inside
the scheduler transfers control to this new process. When a
process has done all its work, sched is called which saves and
restores the intena, also calling swtch to return the control back
to the scheduler.


Question 2:
In fork, in addition to the virtual space, the trap frame of the 
parent is copied to the child which contains the information about
where the user-level application is located. The child process 
uses this information to return to the user level application.


Question 3:
Kill indirectly calls exit. Kill in xk takes a given pid and finds
the corresponding process, setting itâ€™s killed flag to true. The 
process does not exit until it returns to the user space and the 
trap checks if the process is killed and then calls exit on the 
process. 


Question 4:
