Question1:
a) Line 22 in main prints the cpu information
b) Line 23 in main prints the physical memory table


Question 2:
The memory address of main is 0xffffffff8010342c

GDB works with virtual addresses, not physical addresses


Question 3:
If the kernel and user-application are mapped to different address 
spaces, it will result in additional computations for each system
call for address conversion. By mapping the kernel and user-application
to the same address space, it reduces a layer of abstration that would
otherwise result in more overhead for each system call.


Qustion 4:
The difference between the two malloc is that the xk kernel malloc 
allocates 4096-byte of contiguous physical memory each time, whereas the
xk user malloc can allocate a variable amount of memory in the heap of 
user-application's virtual address space. The difference of this is 
because an user-application doesn't know about physical memory, as only 
the operating system knows about the mapping between virtual and physical 
addresses.

The difference between the two prinf is that the xk user printf requires a
file descriptor as an input parameter, whereas the xk kernel printf doesn't.
This difference is because the xk user printf can print to any file, whereas
the xk kernel input can only print to the console, so the file descriptor is
used to check whether the user-application is printing to an opened file. 


Question 5:
pushq  $0x40


Question 6:
A trap frame is 176 bytes large.


Question 7:
The kernel functions that are reported by the backtrace when it reaches 
sys_write are syscall() in kernel/syscall.c, trap() in kernel/trap.c, and 
alltraps() in kernel/trapasm.S.

Question 8:
We both worked for 30 hours on the project.
